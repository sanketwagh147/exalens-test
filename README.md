# Adding More Publishers (Sensors)

To add more publishers (sensors), you can copy any device block in the `docker-compose.yml` file and tweak the environment variables as required. This will spin up another container and start publishing to the broker.

```yaml
  device_05:
    build:
      context: ./publishers/sensor
    container_name: device_05
    networks:
      - my-mosquitto
    environment:
      - FREQUENCY=120
      - RANGE=-10,30
      - SENSOR_ID=sensor_temperature_03
      - SENSOR_TYPE=temperature
      - PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1
